# Building a Portfolio Using Github Pages


Hi! I'm Ishan Khandelwal and in this page I'm going to document my experience of building a personal blog/portfolio using Github pages and Jekyll.
To give you a little bit of background about me, I'm a backend guy and have absolutely no prior experience of building a website.
However, I have watched a couple of YouTube videos on creating personal blogs using Github Pages and Jekyll and I feel reasonably confident that I can build a decent website by leveraging on some of the existing open-source Jekyll themes and modifying them to fit my needs.

## Content
___
Thanks to the open-source community, there are tons of beautiful Jekyll themes available publically over the internet.
But before I go theme-hunting I would be prudent to first create a blueprint for my portfolio/blog. This would help me better understand my needs and would significantly narrow down my search radius. So here we go-


### Home Page
This would perhaps be the most artistic page of the website. This page has to beautiful since the attractiveness of this page will form the first impression on the visitors. As of now, I don't the finer details of how this page should look. But I'm fairly certain that it would atleast contain an image of myself and a brief intro.

This is quite self-explanatory. I'll give an in-depth explanation of myself in this page.
