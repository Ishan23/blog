# Building a Portfolio Using Github Pages


Hi! I'm Ishan Khandelwal and in this page I'm going to document my experience of building a personal blog/portfolio using Github pages and Jekyll.
To give you a little bit of background about me, I'm a backend guy and have absolutely no prior experience of building a website.
However, I have watched a couple of YouTube videos on creating personal blogs using Github Pages and Jekyll and I feel I can create a decent website by leveraging on some of the existing open-source Jekyll themes and modifying them to fit my needs.
